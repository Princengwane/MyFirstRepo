My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

In the coming year, my primary academic goal is to successfully complete my current pathway program and transition into a 
full degree program in CS or a related field. I am determined to deepen my knowledge in areas such as
Software engineering , data analytics and emerging technologies like AI and Cybersecurity. 
Personally, I aim to build stronger academic habits, expand my professional network, and take on leadership roles
in group projects or student communities.
Ultimately, I want to continue growing as a resourceful, disciplined learner who contributes meaningfully to both academic and real-world
environments.
